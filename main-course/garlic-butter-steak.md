Servings: 2

## Equipment
- [ ] oven
- [ ] wire rack
- [ ] baking sheet
- [ ] pan
- [ ] large spoon
- [ ] tongs

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 ribeye steak, 2 inch (5 cm) thick, preferably USDA Prime
- [ ] salt, to taste
- [ ] pepper, to taste
- [ ] 3 tablespoons canola oil
- [ ] 3 tablespoons butter
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- [ ] 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- [ ] 3 sprigs fresh thyme

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 200&deg;F
- Generously season all sides of the **steak** with **salt** and **pepper**.
- Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, then bake for about 45 minutes to an hour until the internal temperature reads about 125&deg;F (51&deg;C) for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time based on if you like your steak more rare or more well-done.
- Heat the **canola oil** in a pan over high heat until smoking. (do not use olive oil)
- Sear the **steak** for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip.
- Add the **butter**, **garlic**, **rosemary**, and **thyme** and swirl around the pan.
- Transfer the **garlic** and **herbs** on top of the **steak** and baste the **steak** with the **butter** using a large spoon.
- Baste for about 30 seconds, then flip and baste the other side for about 15 seconds.
- Turn the **steak** on its side and cook to render off any excess fat.
- Rest the **steak** on a cutting board or wire rack for about 10 minutes. Slicing the **steak** before the resting period has finished will result in a lot of the juices leaking out, which may not be desirable.
- Slice the **steak** into Â½ -inch (1 cm) strips, then fan out the slices and serve.
