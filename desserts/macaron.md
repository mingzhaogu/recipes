## Equipment
- [ ] oven with convection setting
- [ ] baking sheets / silicone baking mats
- [ ] fine-mesh sieve
- [ ] pastry bag with 1/4-inch or 1/3-inch round tip (or ziploc bag)

## Ingredients

### Shells
- [ ] 3/4 cup or 100 grams - ground almonds (almond flour)
- [ ] 3/4 cup or 100 grams - powdered sugar (icing sugar)
- [ ] 2 - medium free-range egg whites
- [ ] pinch of salt
- [ ] 1/4 cup or 55 grams - caster sugar (fine sugar)

### Filling
- [ ] 2/3 cup or 150 grams - _softened_ unsalted butter
- [ ] 1/3 cup or 75 grams - icing sugar (powdered sugar)
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, almond or mint extract

## Instructions

- Preheat oven 275&deg;F on convection setting

### Bowl 1
- Sieve icing sugar and ground almonds into large bowl. Remove any leftover lumps. Mix thoroughly.

### Bowl 2
- In a scrupulously clean bowl, whisk egg whites until soft peaks form.
- Add caster sugar, a little at a time, until whites are very thick and glossy. (Until you are able to hold the bowl upside down without the egg whites falling.)
- Stir icing sugar and almond mix into egg whites until "macaronage".
  - make a "figure 8" with the batter as it falls from the spatula. if you can make a full figure eight, the batter has been incorporated enough. it will be quite loose, don't worry this is the way it should be.
- Fill macaron mixture in piping bag.

### On The Baking Sheet
- Pipe small blobs onto the sheet.
- Gently tap the baking sheet a few times on the work surface to help the macaron mixture to settle and to break any air bubbles.
- Let sit for 40 min - 1 hour, until the surface is smooth, shiny and marshmellow-y.
- Bake the macarons in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
- Slide the mat or greaseproof paper onto a wire cooling rack and leave to cool thoroughly.

### Filling
- Beat the softened butter until it is fluffy, really fluffy.
- Gradually beat in the icing sugar.
